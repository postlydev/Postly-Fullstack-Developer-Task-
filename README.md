# Postly-Fullstack-Developer-Task

Imagine a client uploads any video format .WMV, .MOV, .FLV etc and of any size.

Build a server that can do the following transcoding on the video

1. Convert it to an MP4
2. Convert it to a vertical video that can be uploaded to TikTok.
3. Constrain the size of the video to below 50MB.
4. Then send it back to the client
5. Try to use as little resources on your server as possible.
6. NodeJS is not compulsory. You are free to use your favourite programming language to build the server.
